# Gilson Varghese Blog
Welcome to my technical blog. It will be my portfolio as well as a guide to budding developers and electronics enthusiasts. The content will entail:
1. Technical issues I faced and the best ways to solve it.
2. Source code and hardware diagrams of some cool projects, I have built.
3. Q&A and how to guides on various technologies.

Happy Making!

## Jekyll Now
I have used Jekyll to create the website. 
**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))
